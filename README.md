# Attendify

## Overview

Welcome to the Attendify project! This initiative aims to streamline the entry process for events organized by our club. Instead of traditional methods like using formal Excel sheets, we are transitioning to a more efficient and secure system using QR codes. This project is built on the popular MERN stack, utilizing Mysql, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

## Project Description

The project revolves around generating and scanning QR codes for event attendees. Instead of relying on manual entry processes or physical tickets, participants will receive a unique QR code that serves as their digital entry pass.

## Tech Stack

- **Mysql:** Database for storing attendee information securely.
- **Express.js:** Framework for building the backend server.
- **React:** Frontend library for creating dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

## How it Works

1. **QR Code Generation:** Prior to the event, each participant will be provided with a personalized QR code containing essential information.

2. **Event Day Entry:** At the event venue, our team will utilize a QR code scanner to validate entries. This eliminates the need for time-consuming manual check-ins and minimizes the chances of errors.

3. **Data Management:** The system ensures seamless data management. All attendee information is securely stored in MongoDB and easily accessible, facilitating post-event analysis and reporting.

4. **Transition from Excel Sheets:** We are moving away from the conventional use of formal Excel sheets for managing attendees. The QR system is not only more efficient but also enhances the overall experience for both participants and organizers.
